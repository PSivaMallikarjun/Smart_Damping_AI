# SmartDampingAI

## 🌟 Project Overview
SmartDampingAI is an **AI-powered Active Damping System** designed to mitigate structural vibrations caused by seismic activities, mining blasts, or industrial operations. This system employs **machine learning, IoT sensors, and real-time analytics** to detect and counteract vibrations, ensuring enhanced structural stability.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Vibration Monitoring** using IoT sensors
- **AI-Based Predictive Analysis** for early risk detection
- **Automated Damping Activation** to counteract vibrations
- **Cloud-Based Data Processing** for historical analysis
- **Customizable Response Mechanism** based on environmental conditions

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
